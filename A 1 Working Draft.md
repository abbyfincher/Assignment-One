# Ghost Hunting For The Beginner
## A step by step guide of how to begin ghost hunting

Ghost hunting can be a great hobby to get into! It can be enjoyable to be scared out of your wits and to get an adrenaline rush from the creepy and sometimes chaotic things that can happen while ghost hunting. Many professional ghost hunters enjoy hunting for the history of the places they visit and the story of those who may have died and become the ghosts that are now haunting from the beyond. The following steps will present a short introduction in what is needed to begin hunting for the paranormal, how to stay safe, and how to have fun when hunting for your first ghosts! 

### Step 1: Preparation

Preparation is key in any situation, but it is especially important when one wishes to pursue the hobby of hunting ghosts or observing paranormal activity. - Add list of things needed and advise from other experts. 

### Step 2: Where To?

Looking up sites of possible paranormal activity is important when wondering where to start your ghost hunt. Don't begin with a high activity site - instead, start small and build your way up. Beginning in your grandparent's attic, for example, is a great place for beginners to expand their ghost hunting senses

### Step 3: OBSERVATIONS

This is where that paper and pencil come in! Recording anything you see on paper is a great way to recall things that a video camera may not have picked up. Add more detail later

### Step 4: Have Fun!

Don't want to go alone? (I wouldn't either). Convince a friend crazy enough to go with you! Ghost hunting alone can be rather creepy and the reassurance of a friend can make the experience, 1) more fun, and 2) less scary. Don't be afraid to play a practical joke or two while you're at it. 

Ghost hunting is a skill and a hobby. Grab a flashlight and a friend and hit that road looking for those who have not passed on to the afterlife! And don't let that creepy face in the window end with the curiosity about ghosts. Go looking for them, build your skillset, and have fun!
