# Ghost Hunting For The Beginner
## A step by step guide of how to begin ghost hunting

Ghost hunting can be a great hobby to get into! It can be enjoyable to be scared out of your wits and to get an adrenaline rush from the creepy and sometimes chaotic things that can happen while ghost hunting. Many professional ghost hunters enjoy hunting for the history of the places they visit and the story of those who may have died and become the ghosts that are now haunting from the beyond. The following steps will present a short introduction in what is needed to begin hunting for the paranormal, how to stay safe, and how to have fun when hunting for your first ghosts! 

### Step 1: Preparation

Preparation is key in any situation, but it is especially important when one wishes to pursue the hobby of hunting ghosts or observing paranormal activity. You never know what could happen. The following items may be helpful in your first and future ghost hunts:
1) Camera 
2) Tape recorder
3) Pen and Paper
4) Laptop
5) First Aid Kit
6) Cell Phone
Bringing a camera will help you capture images of ghosts in photographs or video recordings. It is always interesting to see what you've "caught" when scrolling through the images at a later date or even later that day. A tape recorder could capture ghostly voices that may be impercetible to the human ear. Participating in a Q and A session with your potential ghost can reveal some awesome information. First, it lets you know if you have actually encountered a ghost. Second, asking questions helps you to "get to know" the ghost that is in the room with you. This could help you know its name and possibly what its life was like when it was a human. Ghostly voices are sometimes difficult to decipher, but with some practice and training, you could be one of the experts in no time!
Bringing a first aid kit is important, especially if searching through warn down buildings that have rusty nails and possible tripping hazards. Any cut big enough to warrant immmediate car can be primarily treated with a first aid kit, but if that cut is more of gash, that cell phone is important. It can help you call 911 in an emergency or a friend if you need a quick getaway and your car will not start because of that vengeful spirit possessing the engine. 
We will discuss pen and paper and the use of a laptop in a later section.

### Step 2: Where To?

Looking up sites of possible paranormal activity is important when wondering where to start your ghost hunt. Don't begin with a high activity site - instead, start small and build your way up. Beginning in your grandparent's attic, for example, is a great place for beginners to expand their ghost hunting senses. Location is key. Deciding what type of spirit you would like to encounter is one of the first steps in deciding on which location you will go to. Lost souls, murder victims, playful spirits, angry spirits, vengeful spirits - the list goes on and on. If you do not wish to encounter something horribly terrifying the first time around, maybe pick a location with less ominous paranormal activity...like the local graveyard. 


### Step 3: Observations

Observations could be anything from a curtain blowing in a windless window or that ominous voice whispering in your ear as you walk through a hallway. Do not discount anything, and do not leave anything out. The smallest occurence could be significant. Recording your observations for future ghost hunts is key. This is where that paper and pencil come in! Recording anything you see on paper is a great way to recall things that a video camera may not have picked up. If you type faster than you can write with pencil and paper, bring that along and record anything you see. Knowing what you've seen helps you in expectations for future hunts and future encounters.

### Step 4: Trapping a Ghost

Yes, I said trapping a ghost. It can be done...in theory. One very common method in the attempt to capture a ghost is 

### Step : Have Fun!

Don't want to go alone? (I wouldn't either). Convince a friend crazy enough to go with you! Ghost hunting alone can be rather creepy and the reassurance of a friend can make the experience, 1) more fun, and 2) less scary. Don't be afraid to play a practical joke or two while you're at it. 

Ghost hunting is a skill and a hobby. Grab a flashlight and a friend and hit that road looking for those who have not passed on to the afterlife! And don't let that creepy face in the window end with the curiosity about ghosts. Go looking for them, build your skillset, and have fun!
