## Pros

It was fun to research about my topic and to write something different than wildlife bio papers like I have for the past 4 years. I felt I could go outside my major(s) and pick a topic that was just fun to write and research about. It wasn't too serious, and that made it a little more enjoyable to work on. There was still research involved, but it was fun research. Allowing us to pick our topics helped a lot more than forcing us to write about something we just don't care about whatsoever. I felt I began to pick up A LITTLE more on Github and markdown than before I started this project. It could still use some work, but we're getting there. 

## Cons

Twas up rather late into the eve with coffee induced hysteria and stress induced self-loathing. The assignment was...okay. It was easier, let's say, than the rest of my classes, but it was not explained in the best of ways. There was still a lot of confusion as to what you wanted, and I hope I fulfilled the requirements. There were no real guidelines besides the introduction paragraphs and the FAQ section. We did not know if you wanted us to cite sources that we used or if you did not want them. It could have been explained a little better in that manner. Also, referring to text for most college students is more of a confusion factor than hearing what your prof. wants from you. Clear and concise and sometimes a little more detailed instructions would help.

I still don't like using Github, although I did learn more about how it works. I still prefer Word over Markdown or plain text because that's what I'm used to and that's what I like using. I know Markdown is good for science articles and all that jazz, but for those of us who have grown up using Microsoft Word and know it forwards and backwards, Markdown, plain text, and Github just aren't all that great. I am nervous as to what my grade will be. So...I hope you like ghost hunts! 

## Last Remarks

This assignment was meh. Yes, it was fun to do a paper on something not that serious, but it was still an assignment. An assignment I cannot mess up because they are the only things that give us grades in this class - which makes it stressful for us. There's not a lot of redemptive stuff to do if we fail an assignment. Just saying. Which makes me more nervous for my grade than I should be.
